🔷 Project: ARIK – AI-Based Personal Assistant
📌 Role: Developer
🛠️ Tech Stack: Python, SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, Tkinter, Webbrowser, OS module

🧠 Description:
ARIK is a voice-enabled AI assistant developed using Python. It performs daily automation tasks such as:

Opening websites (Google, YouTube, etc.)

Telling time and date

Playing music from the system

Giving system information

Responding to commands through voice interaction

Basic GUI using Tkinter

The project uses Python libraries like speech_recognition for input and pyttsx3 for output. It mimics real-time personal assistant behavior while allowing further integration with APIs or automation features.

🚀 Why ARIK?
This project was built to explore voice AI applications, offline speech processing, and personal productivity tools. It showcases my understanding of automation, human-computer interaction, and Python development.
